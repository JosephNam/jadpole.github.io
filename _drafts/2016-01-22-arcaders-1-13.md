1. Download, initialize, test the library
2. Load the song

We must store the track inside of our view, because the track automatically
stops whenever it is destroyed. This not only means that the music will stop
when you leave the view without having to do anything special about it, it also
implies that you can keep the same music playing as you switch between views
without interruption, simply by passing the object. All hail affine types!

TODO: Allow to pause the game with escape without leaving the game: PauseView
which still stores the data for the game view. Keeps the score, and continues to
play the music, but in a faded way.

Store the explosion sound inside of the explosion object, so that when it is
destroyed, the sound stops. (???, what about reusing the sound?)

3. Continue music in the other view. For that, we change `ViewAction` to:

```rust
enum ViewAction {
    //? ...
    ChangeView(Box<FnOnce(&mut Phi, Box<View>) -> Box<View>>),
}

match view.render() {
    ChangeView(f) =>
        current_view = f(&mut phi, current_view),
}

// Show how to downgrade trait objects.

let old_view = (old_view as Box<GameView>).unwrap();
```

In the previous article, we finally allowed our player to fight its foes: a
swarm of randomly created asteroids. Not the most epic of battles, but at least
our program works! In this article, we will start polishing our game by adding
audio to it. Asteroids will go "boom!", bullets will go "pew", and we will add
some [epic music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x49T4Vyb7m0) so our game at
least _sounds_ intense.

Let's get working!


## The last dependency

For the task at hand, we will need yet another library; yet another plugin for
SDL2. This time, we will use andelf's
[rust-sdl2_mixer](https://github.com/andelf/rust-sdl2_mixer). Notice that he's
also the person that maintains the Rust bindings for SDL2_image, so you should
expect some similarities.

First, let's add this library to our `Cargo.toml` dependencies:

```
[dependencies]
rand = "0.3"
sdl2 = "0.13"
sdl2_image = "1.0.0"
sdl2_mixer = "0.12"
sdl2_ttf = "0.13.1"
```

Then, let's import it in `main.rs`:

```rust
extern crate sdl2_mixer;
```

You may have to install the developer packages for SDL2\_mixer. Because the
process varies drastically from one platform to the next, I'll let you figure
that part out.

As you have probably guessed by now, the next step is to create a handler that
will initialize and clean up behind the plugin in `phi/mod.rs`. We will
configure our audio channel at the same time.

```rust
pub fn spawn<F>(title: &str, init: F)
where F: Fn(&mut Phi) -> Box<View> {
    //? Initialize SDL2
    //? ...

    // Initialize audio
    //? We will stick to the Ogg format throughout this article. However, you
    //? can easily require new
    let _mixer_context = ::sdl2_mixer::init(::sdl2_mixer::INIT_OGG).unwrap();
    //? We configure our audio context so that:
    //?   * The frequency is 44100;
    //?   * Use signed 16 bits samples, in little-endian byte order;
    //?   * It's also stereo (2 "channels");
    //?   * Samples are 1024 bytes in size.
    //? You don't really need to understand what all of this means. I myself just
    //? copy-pasted this from andelf's demo.
    ::sdl2_mixer::open_audio(44100, ::sdl2_mixer::AUDIO_S16LSB, 2, 1024).unwrap();
    //? This function asks us how many channels we wish to allocate for our game.
    //? That is, how many sounds do we wish to be able to play at the same time?
    //? While testing, 16 channels seemed to be sufficient. Which means that we
    //? should probably request 32 of 'em just in case. :-°
    ::sdl2_mixer::allocate_channels(32);

    //? ...
}
```

Now that this is out of the way, we can add some music to our game!


## Epic music

The song that we will play throughout our game will be the orchestral remix of
_Phoenix_ by [MDK](http://www.morgandavidking.com/), whose work I
<span title="No, seriously, you should take a few minute and listen to that stuff, it's real good.">particularly enjoy</span>.

<audio controls>
  <source src="/assets/mdk_phoenix_orchestral.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
  Your browser does not support the audio element. Get the file
  <a href="/assets/mdk_phoenix_orchestral.ogg">here</a>.
</audio>

You should save it as `assets/mdk_phoenix_orchestral.ogg`.

SDL2\_mixer allows us to load music with the `Music::new` associated function. It
returns a `Result<Music, String>`. Because we can be pretty confident that
whatever file we wish to access exists &mdash; otherwise, we would like a quick
crash to inform us that we were wrong &mdash; we can simply unwrap the result:

```rust
use sdl2_mixer::Music;

//? ...

let music =
    Music::from_file(Path::new("assets/mdk_phoenix_orchestral.ogg"))
    //? If the file cannot be loaded, then the error message will be:
    //?
    //>   thread '<main>' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value:
    //>   ErrorMessage("Couldn\'t open assets/mdk_phoenix_orchestral.ogg")', ../src/libcore/result.rs:741
    //>   Process didn't exit successfully: `target/debug/arcade-rs` (exit code: 101)
    //?
    //? It ain't optimal, but it should be good enough for our purposes.
    .unwrap();
```

As you may be able to guess, we can play `music` using the `play` method. This
method expects an integer indicating _how many times_ it should be _repeated_.
That is, it will be played once more than whatever number was passed to it.
Moreover, `play` doesn't expect to receive a `usize`, but an `isize`. That is,
we can send it a negative amount of repetitions. This allows us to loop over the
same music "infinitely".

```rust
impl Music {
    // Attempt to play the music `loops + 1` times. If the provided integer is
    // negative, then play the song as many times as possible until `self`
    // is dropped.
    pub fn play(&self, loops: isize) -> SdlResult<()>;
    //? ...
}
```

For the sake of brevity, we won't do anything _incredible_ with sound, like
start some specific music as we approach the boss' lair &mdash; although Rust
makes this particularly easy. We will keep it simple and loop over the same song
throughout the entire duration of the game. This means that we will call:

```rust
// Play the song over and over again until `music` is dropped.
music.play(-1).unwrap();
```

What is interesting with andelf's bindings of SDL2\_mixer is that, whenever a
`Music` object is dropped, it stops playing. This makes switching between musics
incredibly easy:

```rust
//? The previous value of `current_music` is dropped: the music is stopped.
current_music = new_music;
//? Mere instants afterwards, the next instruction executes and the new song
//? starts playing. There will not be any noticeable "moment of silence".
current_music.play(-1).unwrap();
```

This stops the currently playing music and starts looping over some other song
instead. That also means that we can continue playing the same song throughout
many views without having to restart or pause it. This is possible and safe
because of Rust's affine type-system. Indeed, while the same behaviour would be
complicated to implement in say, Java or C++, it is trivial to do in Rust: you
just move a value.

Alright, let's get back to what we are trying to achieve: let's play some music
in `GameView`!

```rust
use sdl2_mixer::Music;

//? ...

pub struct GameView {
    //? ...
    music: Music,
}

impl GameView {
    pub fn with_backgrounds(phi: &mut Phi, bg: BgSet) -> GameView {
        let music =
            Music::from_file(Path::new("assets/mdk_phoenix_orchestral.ogg"))
            .unwrap();

        music.play(-1).unwrap();

        GameView {
            //? ...
            music: music,
        }
    }
}
```

That's it! With those six extra lines, music should play whenever you start a
new game and stop whenever you press escape and return to the main menu &mdash;
because then, `GameView` is dropped, and so are all of its attributes, including
`music`.


## Of bullets and explosions

While `Music` is used to represent longer sounds, which are gradually read from
the file as they are needed, SDL2\_mixer uses `Chunk` to describe shorter sounds
that are played often. This is the type that we will use to store the audio
played when firing bullets and blowing up asteroids.

Here's the chunk that we will use to fire bullets:

<audio controls>
  <source src="/assets/bullet.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
  Your browser does not support the audio element. Get the file
  <a href="/assets/bullet.ogg">here</a>.
</audio>

And here's the other one, which we will use to make stuff explode:

<audio controls>
  <source src="/assets/explosion.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
  Your browser does not support the audio element. Get the file
  <a href="/assets/explosion.ogg">here</a>.
</audio>

<!--

        In the public domain.

-->

Let's load and store those from within our game:

```rust
use sdl2_mixer::{Chunk, Music};

//? ...

pub struct GameView {
    //? ...

    music: Music,
    bullet_sound: Chunk,
    explosion_sound: Chunk,
}

impl GameView {
    pub fn with_backgrounds(phi: &mut Phi, bg: BgSet) -> GameView {
        let music =
            Music::from_file(Path::new("assets/mdk_phoenix_orchestral.ogg"))
            .unwrap();

        music.play(-1).unwrap();

        let bullet_sound =
            Chunk::from_file(Path::new("assets/bullet.ogg"))
            .unwrap();

        let explosion_sound =
            Chunk::from_file(Path::new("assets/explosion.ogg"))
            .unwrap();

        GameView {
            //? ...

            // Sound
            music: music,
            bullet_sound: bullet_sound,
            explosion_sound: explosion_sound,
        }
    }
}
```

You should verify that this code compiles and runs properly &mdash; that is,
that you have correctly downloaded and referred to the chunks.

If that worked, it is time to play some sound! For this, we will use the
`Channel` type, which allows us to play one chunk at a time. Then, the library
will automatically go through every channel that it allocated and mix them
together. The result will be sent to your hardware and transformed to those
vibrations that we call "sound".

A nice feature of SDL2\_mixer, and many other similar libraries, is that we do
not actually have to deal with channels, at least not manually. By using
`Channel::all()`, we ask SDL2\_mixer to find _some available channel_, we do not
care which. Then, we tell this channel which chunk to play, how many times to
repeat it, and everything should work properly, yay!

More specifically, to play a sound once, we write this:

```rust
::sdl2_mixer::Channel::all().play(&my_chunk, 0);
```

The `play` method returns a `Result`. If there indeed _was_ an available
channel, it returns `Ok`. If there wasn't, then it returns `Err`. The question
now is: how should we handle an error? Crashing the program would be slightly
drastic, and some missing sounds here and there probably won't ruin the
experience. Yet, if not enough channels were available, it would be nice to fix
this and allocate some more.

Here's my solution to this issue: first, we remove the call to
`allocate_channels` from `phi::spawn`; then, we update `Phi` so that it takes
care of allocating enough channels automatically.

```rust
/// Bundles the Phi abstractions in a single structure which
/// can be passed easily between functions.
pub struct Phi<'window> {
    pub events: Events,
    pub renderer: Renderer<'window>,

    allocated_channels: isize,
    cached_fonts: HashMap<(&'static str, i32), ::sdl2_ttf::Font>,
}

impl<'window> Phi<'window> {
    fn new(events: Events, renderer: Renderer<'window>) -> Phi<'window> {
        // We start with 32 mixer channels, which we may grow if necessary.
        let allocated_channels = 32;
        ::sdl2_mixer::allocate_channels(allocated_channels);

        Phi {
            events: events,
            renderer: renderer,
            allocated_channels: allocated_channels,
            cached_fonts: HashMap::new(),
        }
    }

    //? ...

    /// Play a sound once, and allocate new channels if this is necessary.
    pub fn play_sound(&mut self, sound: &::sdl2_mixer::Chunk) {
        // Attempt to play the sound once.
        match ::sdl2_mixer::Channel::all().play(sound, 0) {
            Err(_) => {
                // If there weren't enough channels allocated, then we double
                // that number and try again.
                self.allocated_channels *= 2;
                ::sdl2_mixer::allocate_channels(self.allocated_channels);
                self.play_sound(sound);
            },

            _ => { /* Everything's Alright! */ }
        }
    }
}
```

This should work just fine! We should now be able to play this sound inside of
our game's logic. In `views/game.rs`, add the following:

```rust
impl View for GameView {
    fn render(&mut self, phi: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ViewAction {
        //? ...

        self.asteroids =
            ::std::mem::replace(&mut self.asteroids, vec![])
            .into_iter()
            .filter_map(|asteroid| {
                //? ...

                if asteroid_alive {
                    Some(asteroid)
                } else {
                    // Spawn an explosive wherever an asteroid was destroyed.
                    self.explosions.push(
                        self.explosion_factory.at_center(
                            asteroid.rect().center()));

                    phi.play_sound(&self.explosion_sound);

                    None
                }
            })
            .collect();

        //? ...

        if phi.events.now.key_space == Some(true) {
            self.bullets.append(&mut self.player.spawn_bullets());
            phi.play_sound(&self.bullet_sound);
        }

        //? ...
    }
}
```

It ain't more complicated than that. If you followed along, you should now be
able to play your game as you did before, except that now, there's audio stuff!


## Viewception

What I would like to do now is: create another view that is used whenever you
wish to pause the game without losing your progress. I would like the song to
continue playing while we are in this view, although with way smaller gain.
However, as of right now, this is simply impossible with the way that we
designed our library! Consider this obvious, but bad, solution:

```rust
impl View for GameView {
    fn render(&mut self, phi: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ViewAction {
        //? ...

        if phi.events.now.key_escape == Some(true) {
            return ViewAction::ChangeView(Box::new(
                ::views::pause::PausedView::with_game_state(self)));
        }

        //? ...
    }
}
```

This will not compile, and for a very simple reason: we do not actually _own_
our view when writing the body of `render`. What we have instead is a
_mutable reference_ to our view, that is, we promised the phi engine that we
would give it back its view, and the compiler's gonna make sure that we
collaborate.

Notice that we could use a more functional approach and use this instead:

```rust
pub trait View {
    fn render(self: Box<Self>, context: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ViewAction;
}

pub enum ViewAction {
    Render(Box<View>),
    Quit,
}

impl View for GameView {
    fn render(mut self: Box<Self>, phi: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ViewAction {
        if phi.events.now.quit {
            //? Notice that `self` is not passed to `Quit`, therefore it goes
            //? out of scope here. This means that `self` will be dropped just
            //? before the method returns.
            return ViewAction::Quit;
        }

        if phi.events.now.key_escape == Some(true) {
            // Render a new view instead
            return ViewAction::Render(Box::new(
                ::views::pause::PausedView::with_game_state(self)));
        }
    }
}
```

This is clean, nice; this is even efficient! Indeed, because our data structure
is stored in a `Box`, it is allocated on the _heap_ and thus the only thing that
we are passing around is a pointer &mdash; an integer.

<!--This also means that the
hack that we used with `mem::replace()` is no longer necessary.-->

Also, because we wish our view to keep rendering while our game is paused, it is
necessary to separate our process in two methods: `update` and `render`.

This means that we have to change a few things, but it's surprisingly not that
hard to integrate in our code base &mdash; and it's a good occasion to check out
how refactoring works out on non-trivial code bases. The first step, obviously,
is to change how the phi library operates. Let's modify `phi/mod.rs`:

```rust
//? ...

/// A `ViewAction` is a way for the currently executed view to communicate with
/// the game loop. It specifies whether an action should be executed before the
/// next rendering.
pub enum ViewAction {
    Render(Box<View>),
    Quit,
}


/// Interface through which Phi interacts with the possible states in which the
/// application can be.
pub trait View {
    /// Called on every frame to take care of the logic of the program. From
    /// user inputs and the instance's internal state, determine whether to
    /// render itself or another view, close the window, etc.
    ///
    /// `elapsed` is expressed in seconds.
    fn update(self: Box<Self>, context: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ViewAction;

    /// Called on every frame to take care rendering the current view. It
    /// disallows mutating the object by default, although you may still do it
    /// through a `RefCell` if you need to.
    fn render(&self, context: &mut Phi) -> ViewAction;
}

//? ...

pub fn spawn<F>(title: &str, init: F)
where F: Fn(&mut Phi) -> Box<View> {
    //? Initialization stuff...

    loop {
        //? Frame timing...

        // Logic & rendering

        context.events.pump(&mut context.renderer);

        match current_view.update(&mut context, elapsed) {
            ViewAction::Render(view) => {
                current_view = view;
                current_view.render(&mut context);
                context.renderer.present();
            },

            ViewAction::Quit =>
                break,
        }
    }
}
```

Now for the complicated part: upgrading all the things! We will start by
updating our game's view, then we will fix the main menu. In `views/game.rs`,
we now have:

```rust
impl View for GameView {
    fn update(self: Box<Self>, phi: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ViewAction {
        if phi.events.now.quit {
            return ViewAction::Quit;
        }

        if phi.events.now.key_escape == Some(true) {
            return ViewAction::ChangeView(Box::new(
                ::views::main_menu::MainMenuView::with_backgrounds(
                    phi, self.bg)));
        }


        // Update the player
        self.player.update(phi, elapsed);

        // Update the bullets
        self.bullets =
            self.bullets.into_iter()
            .filter_map(|bullet| bullet.update(phi, elapsed))
            .collect();

        // Update the asteroids
        self.asteroids =
            self.asteroids.into_iter()
            .filter_map(|asteroid| asteroid.update(elapsed))
            .collect();

        // Update the explosions
        self.explosions =
            self.explosions.into_iter()
            .filter_map(|explosion| explosion.update(elapsed))
            .collect();


        // Collision detection

        let mut player_alive = true;

        let mut transition_bullets: Vec<_> =
            self.bullets.into_iter()
            .map(|bullet| MaybeAlive { alive: true, value: bullet })
            .collect();

        self.asteroids =
            self.asteroids.into_iter()
            .filter_map(|asteroid| {
                // By default, the asteroid has not been in a collision.
                let mut asteroid_alive = true;

                for bullet in &mut transition_bullets {
                    if asteroid.rect().overlaps(bullet.value.rect()) {
                        asteroid_alive = false;
                        bullet.alive = false;
                    }
                }

                // The player's ship is destroyed if it is hit by an asteroid.
                // In which case, the asteroid is also destroyed.
                if asteroid.rect().overlaps(self.player.rect) {
                    asteroid_alive = false;
                    player_alive = false;
                }

                if asteroid_alive {
                    Some(asteroid)
                } else {
                    // Spawn an explosive wherever an asteroid was destroyed.
                    //? Does not compile:
                    //?
                    //>   error: cannot borrow `self` (here through borrowing
                    //>     `self.explosion_factory`) as immutable because `self`
                    //>     is also borrowed as mutable (through borrowing
                    //>     `self.explosions`) [E0502]
                    //?
                    self.explosions.push(
                        self.explosion_factory.at_center(

Spoilers: this won't compile! I mean, obviously we cannot update the backgrounds
while rendering them anymore &mdash; this is necessary to upgrade. What is
surprising is that statements such as:

```rust
self.asteroids.push(self.asteroid_factory.random(phi));
```

Are no longer valid. They _should be_ and this is yet another place where the
borrow checker is too restrictive. The reason why this is forbidden also
explains why we must still rely on `mem::replace`, even though we own the value.
The problem is not that Rust cannot tell which fields of a struct are valid,
indeed [it can](http://is.gd/1l52pr), but that the compiler is
[confused by the value being boxed](http://is.gd/xswzJS).

In this case, the fix is pretty simple: we stick to `mem::replace` and we spread
the insertion process on multiple line.

```rust
//? ...

self.asteroids =
    self.asteroids.into_iter()
    .filter_map(|asteroid| {
        //? ...

        if asteroid_alive {
            Some(asteroid)
        } else {
            // Spawn an explosive wherever an asteroid was destroyed.
            let new_explosion =
                self.explosion_factory.at_center(asteroid.rect().center());
            self.explosions.push(new_explosion);

            phi.play_sound(&self.explosion_sound);

            None
        }
    })
    .collect();

//? ...

// Allow the player to shoot after the bullets are updated, so that,
// when rendered for the first time, they are drawn wherever they
// spawned.
if phi.events.now.key_space == Some(true) {
    let mut new_bullets = self.player.spawn_bullets();
    self.bullets.append(&mut new_bullets);
    phi.play_sound(&self.bullet_sound);
}

// Randomly create an asteroid about once every 100 frames, that is,
// a bit more often than once every two seconds.
if ::rand::random::<usize>() % 100 == 0 {
    let new_asteroid = self.asteroid_factory.random(phi);
    self.asteroids.push(new_asteroid);
}
```


We can somewhat easily fix the ownership errors in
``

Notice that a bunch of calls to `clone` and `mem::replace` vanish

This solution is all of these
things, and yet it's not the way that we are going to do things.

Don't get me wrong, this _is_ the way that you would &mdash; and _should_ &mdash;
do it in the "real world". Seriously, what I'm going for here is messy, but it's
_way_ more fun to write and has some nice pedagogical advantages. Those of you
who have some Rust experience might know what's coming:
(higher-order functions, because who doesn't like 'em).
